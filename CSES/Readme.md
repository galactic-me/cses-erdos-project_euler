1. Movie Festivals - https://cses.fi/problemset/result/10590206/
2. Pick-Not-Pick DP solution for Missing Sum (O(n*sum)) solution.
3. For Maximum-sliding-window median question, make sure to not compare integers with different signedness, like signed with unsigned - like in high.size() &
low.size() return unsigned but (k/2) can be signed too, so to avoid this explicitly type cast former, to match the data type of the other.
